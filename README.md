# Xbox Game Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict user interest in Xbox games based on BestBuy search data, allowing for personalized game recommendations to visitors.

## Project Overview

The data generated by users while searching can be used to predict their gaming interests. Using search behavior data provided by BestBuy, this model predicts which Xbox games a user will be most interested in purchasing, enabling targeted game recommendations.

## Project Structure

- **data/** - Contains the raw and processed data files
  - `bestbuy_searches.csv` - Raw search data from BestBuy
  - `game_metadata.csv` - Xbox game information (title, genre, release date, etc.)
  - `processed_train.csv` - Preprocessed training data
  - `processed_test.csv` - Preprocessed test data
  - `recommendations.csv` - Final game recommendations

- **model/** - Contains the saved models
  - `xgb_game_recommender.pkl` - XGBoost model for game recommendations

- **plots/** - Visualizations for model evaluation
  - `genre_popularity.png` - Popularity distribution across game genres
  - `feature_importance.png` - Feature importance in prediction
  - `recommendation_accuracy.png` - Accuracy metrics visualization
  - `user_preferences.png` - User preference distribution

- **Python Scripts**
  - `data_processing.py` - Processes raw BestBuy search data
  - `feature_engineering.py` - Extracts gaming-related features
  - `train_model.py` - Trains the Xbox game recommendation model
  - `evaluate_model.py` - Evaluates model performance and generates visualizations

## Data Processing

1. **Data Loading**: Load raw BestBuy search data and Xbox game metadata
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Clean user search data
   - Extract game-specific search patterns
   - Link search queries to specific Xbox games
   - Combine search data with game metadata
   - Handle missing values and outliers

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract temporal features (time of search, day of week)
   - Create game genre preferences based on search history
   - Calculate recency features (days since game release)
   - Develop user-game affinity scores
   - Generate search pattern features (frequency, duration, etc.)

## Model Implementation

The model uses XGBoost to predict user interest in specific Xbox games:

1. **Training Data Preparation**:
   - User features: search history, prior purchases, time patterns
   - Game features: genre, release date, popularity, price point
   - Interaction features: user-genre affinity, search-purchase correlation

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Gradient boosted decision trees with hyperparameter tuning
   - Early stopping to prevent overfitting
   - Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors

3. **Prediction Output**:
   - Interest score for each user-game pair
   - Ranking of most likely games of interest
   - Confidence metrics for recommendations

## Results

The model provides personalized Xbox game recommendations with the following performance metrics:

- Recommendation precision: 72%
- Recall: 68%
- Mean Average Precision (MAP): 0.65
- User satisfaction score: 4.2/5

## Key Insights

1. **Genre Preferences**: Action and shooter games show the highest overall interest, but individual user preferences vary significantly.

2. **Temporal Patterns**: Game interest spikes shortly after release and during promotional periods.

3. **Search Behaviors**: Users who search for specific game features (e.g., "multiplayer RPG") show higher conversion rates.

4. **Price Sensitivity**: Price point is a more significant factor for casual gamers than for enthusiasts.

## Usage

To reproduce the results:

1. Process the raw data:
   ```
   python data_processing.py
   ```

2. Generate advanced features:
   ```
   python feature_engineering.py
   ```

3. Train the recommendation model:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Evaluate model performance:
   ```
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. Incorporate game review sentiment analysis
2. Add social network influence features
3. Develop a hybrid recommendation system combining content-based and collaborative filtering
4. Implement real-time recommendation updates based on browsing behavior
5. Expand to cross-platform game recommendations 

## Recommendation Dashboard

The project includes a recommendation dashboard that provides comprehensive insights for both retailers and consumers:

### For Retailers
- **Games on Sale**: Shows all Xbox games currently discounted, including discount percentages, sale prices, and sale end dates.
- **Sale Candidates**: Identifies games that would benefit from a promotional discount based on popularity, conversion rates, and pricing metrics.
- **Popular Games**: Lists the most popular games based on a combined score of ratings, popularity metrics, and user interactions.

### For Consumers
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Each user receives customized game recommendations based on their search behavior and predicted interests.
- **Sale Alerts**: Recommendations highlight games currently on sale that match the user's preferences.
- **Popularity Indicators**: Users can see which recommended games are trending with other gamers.

### Dashboard Outputs
- CSV files containing detailed tables for each category
- Visualizations showing genre distributions, discount percentages, and popularity metrics
- Summary statistics providing an overview of the Xbox game ecosystem

To generate the recommendation dashboard:
```
python recommendation_dashboard.py
```

All dashboard files will be saved to the `dashboard` directory.
